# Gigabyte-GA-Z77X-UD5H DSDT Patches

DSDT Patches for the Gigabyte GA-Z77X-UD5H motherboard on OS X

### Full Post Installation with the GA-Z77X-UD5H Script (recommended)
Look [at the wiki](https://github.com/theracermaster/Gigabyte-GA-Z77X-UD5H-DSDT-Patch/wiki) for full installation and post installation instructions for installing OS X.

### Manually Using These Patches (advanced)
These patches can be applied to a cleanly-extracted native DSDT from the Gigabyte GA-Z77X-UD5H motherboard using an editor such as [MaciASL](http://maciasl.sourceforge.net). Add `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theracermaster/Gigabyte-GA-Z77X-UD5H-DSDT-Patch/master` as a repo in MaciASL > Preferences > Sources. Graphics patches are available at the [Gigabyte GA-Z77X Graphics DSDT Patch repo](https://github.com/theracermaster/Gigabyte-GA-Z77X-Graphics-DSDT-Patch) (MaciASL repo: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theracermaster/Gigabyte-GA-Z77X-Graphics-DSDT-Patch/master`)

Special thanks to PJALM, toleda, and RampageDev for their original edits; this would not have been possible if not for their work.
