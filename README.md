# Gigabyte-GA-Z77X DSDT Patch

DSDT Patches for Gigabyte GA-Z77X motherboards on OS X

### Supported Motherboards
Currently, the following motherboards are supported by the GA-Z77X script and the manual DSDT patches in the repo:
- GA-Z77X-D3H
- GA-Z77X-UD5H

### Full Post Installation with the GA-Z77X Script (recommended)
Look [at the wiki](https://github.com/theracermaster/Gigabyte-GA-Z77X-DSDT-Patch/wiki) for full installation and post installation instructions for installing OS X.

### Manually Using These Patches (advanced)
These patches can be applied to a cleanly-extracted native DSDT from a Gigabyte GA-Z77X motherboard using an editor such as [MaciASL](http://maciasl.sourceforge.net). Add `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theracermaster/Gigabyte-GA-Z77X-DSDT-Patch/master` as a repo in MaciASL > Preferences > Sources. Graphics patches are available at the [Gigabyte GA-Z77X Graphics DSDT Patch repo](https://github.com/theracermaster/Gigabyte-GA-Z77X-Graphics-DSDT-Patch) (MaciASL repo: `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/theracermaster/Gigabyte-GA-Z77X-Graphics-DSDT-Patch/master`)

Special thanks to Mieze, Piker-Alpha, PJALM, RampageDev, RehabMan, SJ_Underwater, the-darkvoid, and toleda for their original edits; this would not have been possible if not for their work.
Also, special thanks to [AustinSMU](https://github.com/AustinSMU); the repo design and large parts of the script were based off his [PRECISION-M3800-OSX repo](https://github.com/AustinSMU/PRECISION-M3800-OSX).
