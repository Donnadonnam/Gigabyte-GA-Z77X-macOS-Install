iASL Warning: There were 6 external control methods found during
disassembly, but additional ACPI tables to resolve these externals
were not specified. The resulting disassembler output file may not
compile because the disassembler did not know how many arguments
to assign to these methods. To specify the tables needed to resolve
external control method references, the -e option can be used to
specify the filenames. Example iASL invocations:
    iasl -e ssdt1.aml ssdt2.aml ssdt3.aml -d dsdt.aml
    iasl -e dsdt.aml ssdt2.aml -d ssdt1.aml
    iasl -e ssdt*.aml -d dsdt.aml

In addition, the -fe option can be used to specify a file containing
control method external declarations with the associated method
argument counts. Each line of the file must be of the form:
    External (<method pathname>, MethodObj, <argument count>)
Invocation:
    iasl -fe refs.txt -d dsdt.aml
