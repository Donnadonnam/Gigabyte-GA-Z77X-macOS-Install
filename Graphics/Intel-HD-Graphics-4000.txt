# Intel HD Graphics 4000 DSDT Patch

# Apply the GA-Z77X-UD5H Patch v2 before using this and look at the Graphics README.
# If you are using Intel HD Graphics 4000 as primary GFX with a secondary discrete GPU, apply this patch first, set the IGPU as default GFX in BIOS, and apply the discrete GPU patch afterwards.
#
# Special thanks to PJALM & RampageDev for their original edits; this would not have been possible if not for their work.
